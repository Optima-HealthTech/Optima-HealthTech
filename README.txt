Description: A wearable vest that detects whenever you are slouching, your heart rate, and body heat. This recognizes the issue of people having bad posture and it provides a solution. When the person wearing it slouches past a certain point, the device vibrates and this would serve as a reminder to fix your posture. The vest would also be able to detect heart rate and display it on an app which the user would have access to. It would detect abnormalities with your heart rate. Oftentimes due to us doing various tasks, like running or working out, our heart rates rise. This product will only pick up extremely high changes in heart rate and ignore the rest.The vest also has sensors that detect body heat. Based on body heat, the vest collects data and equalizes your body temperature by either cooling down or heating up. This can be disabled in the app or adjusted.
